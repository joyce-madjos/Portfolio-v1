# Portfolio v1

HelloðŸ‘‹

This website is not only a showcase of my most recent work, but also a personal endeavor. I have personally designedðŸŽ¨ the website, and you can view the Figma prototype via the link provided below. In the months, I have made significant progress as both a developer and a designer, and I wanted to create something that would demonstrate my newly acquired skills and knowledge.
